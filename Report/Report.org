* Swarm Behaviour
  - The swarm seems to go to right direction, defined as to go in the direction vector of ~(1.0, 0.0, 0.0) continuously, in between replenishing itself
  - Also since initially the entities of the swarm are spread apart and reach the globes in different times, their charges also deplete in different times
  - A destination will not become unreachable
  - The center of mass remains the same in this case
  - When done with multiple globes since going in a rightward vector
  - If the vehicle is going somewhere and at that point it needs to change the destination problem (limited to one globe)
* Stage c
  - When the vehicle is going to the swarm in low battery and is about to reach it the globe dies => Problem to a lot of swarms
